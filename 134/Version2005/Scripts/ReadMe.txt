Log into your SQL Server machine with a Windows account that has create database privileges
on the local server.

Copy these files to the c:\134\Scripts folder. Create the folder if necessary.
Modify the two files CreateDB134Database.sql and CreateSourceDB134Database.sql so the paths point to your SQL Server data files folder, e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\DATA

Change to the Scripts folder and run the 134DatabaseSetup.bat file.

That will create and populate the DB134 and SourceDB134 databases.

The solutions to the exercises were saved with a password of 134 if you are prompted for 
a password when you open or run them.
